# Short Exercises - High Performance Computing

This folder contains small C programs for practicing concepts in high performance computing:

- **prod_con.c**: Implementation of the producer-consumer problem using threads and synchronization primitives.
- **tokenring_sem.c**: Demonstrates a token ring algorithm using semaphores for process synchronization.
